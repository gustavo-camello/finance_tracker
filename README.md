# Finance Tracker

## About the project

Finance Tracker allows you to search for Financial Stocks, fetching them from an external API (https://iexcloud.io/),
and adding it to your portfolio. Also you can follow other users and see the stocks they are currently following.

This project is part of my journey to be a better Ruby on Rails developer, I developed
following the instructions from the Udemy Course "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course".
